# Time Series Classification With Random Temporal Features

Recently, time series classification has attracted the attention of a large number of researchers. However, how to efficiently select intuitive temporal features for accurate classification is still a huge challenge. To address this challenge, a novel TSC method based on Random Temporal Features (TSC-RTF) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to extend the shapelets into more intuitive temporal features, TSC-RTF generated temporal feature candidates with the help of some important data points. Next, to speedup the intuitive temporal feature selection process,  random sampling and one-time importance measures are adopted in TSC-RTF. Finally, a classifier based on deep learning is trained to improve the accuracy. Experiments on various public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method obtains a competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.
